## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This repository contains the analytical work and computational tools developed for my IB Mathematics Extended Essay.  
The essay investigates the deep link between two iconic objects in chaos theory:

- **The Mandelbrot set**: generated by the quadratic recurrence  
  \[
  z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
  \]  
  where bulbs of the set correspond to cycles of a given period.

- **The Logistic map**: a nonlinear recurrence relation used to model population growth,  
  \[
  x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n),
  \]  
  whose bifurcation diagram reveals windows of stability and chaos.

The central aim is to **map period-n bulbs of the Mandelbrot set to stability regions of the logistic map**, highlighting their shared dynamical structures.

## Methodology

### Analytical Approach
- Derived stability conditions for cycles of the logistic map by solving:  
  \[
  f_r^k(x) = x, \quad \left|\left(f_r^k\right)'(x)\right| < 1
  \]

- Characterised period-n bulbs in the Mandelbrot set using:  
  \[
  f_c^n(0) = 0, \quad f_c^m(0) \neq 0 \; \forall m < n
  \]

### Computational Approach
- **Bifurcation diagram (logistic map)**  
  - Sweeps across growth rates \( r \)  
  - Discards burn-in and plots long-term behaviour  
  - Detects cycles and stability intervals  

- **Mandelbrot set**  
  - Escape-time algorithm with arbitrary precision zoom  
  - Identification of period-n bulbs and cycle multipliers  
  - Side-by-side comparison with logistic stability windows

- Visualise the Mandelbrot set and highlight bulbs of specific periods  
- Tools to compare stability regions (logistic map) with hyperbolic components (Mandelbrot set)  
- Exportable figures for analysis and EE write-up
